This is a fork of LMMS with fair few extra features for writing electronic music.
Most importantly groove quantising and sample precision note play: so you can play, record and write something funky.
Without this feature, every note is quantised to midi and looses it feeling.

I have written a few versions of this feature for different LMMS versions, because I cant live without it.  Writing house or garage or any thing funky or with soul is horrible/impossible without groove quantising.  The version in this fork is quite stable.  Been running it for years.

You can achieve a similar effect by placing notes manually in piano roll with the grid set to 1/64, but its a slow process and some things are just not possible without sample precision note on.  A twisty knob to turn for "how funky do you want this" is a key tool in my toolbox.

Sample precision note on, make it possible to fixing them nasty issues with sample alignments, inside LMMS instead of have to export samples to a wave editor.
